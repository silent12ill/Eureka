                Code for America was founded in 02009 by Jennifer Pahlka “to make government work better for the people and by the people in the 21st century.”  The organization started a movement to modernize government for a digital age which has now spread from cities to counties to states, and now, most visibly, to the federal government, where Jennifer served at the White House as US Deputy Chief Technology Officer.  There she helped start the United States Digital Service, known as "Obama's stealth startup."Now that thousands of people from "metaphysical Silicon Valley" are working for and with government, what have we learned?  Can government actually be fixed to serve citizens better—especially the neediest?  Why does change in government happen so slowly?Before founding Code for America, Jennifer Pahlka co-created the Web 2.0 and Gov. 2.0 conferences, building on her prior experience organizing computer game developer conferences. She continues to serve as executive director of Code for America, which is based in San Francisco.`,

            description: `Step by Step INSTRUCTIONS:
                Pick up a section of hair from the top of your head.
                Split it into 3 equal sections. Just like with a regular braid, cross the rightmost strand over the middle strand and then the leftmost strand over the middle strand.

                You’re going to continue this, the only difference is that now you also have to add in sections from the sides of your head to those strands.

                There are 2 ways of adding in the sections:

                Method 1:
                -Pick up a section of hair from the right side of head (kind of scoop it up with your thumb) and add it into the right strand. Your strand will become bigger/fuller. Now, cross this strand over the middle strand (just like with a regular braid).

                Repeat this with the left strand: “Scoop” up a section of hair from the left side of your head. Add this section into the left strand and then cross it over the middle strand.

                Repeat this process until you run out of hair, then continue braiding like you would with a regular braid.

                Method 2:
                -With this method you want to start off by crossing over the rightmost strand and THEN pick up a new section of hair from the right side of your head and cross that over as well.

                Repeat with the left side: Cross the leftmost strand over the middle strand,  THEN pick up a section of hair from the left side of you head, which you will also cross over the middle strand.

                Just like with the other method, you want to continue this until you run out of hair, and then continue just like with a regular braid.
                ⭐︎
                And that’s it!
                As I said in the video, it does not matter what method you use, since you’re doing the exact same thing! Personally, I prefer the first method and I also find that it’s easier and quicker! :*
